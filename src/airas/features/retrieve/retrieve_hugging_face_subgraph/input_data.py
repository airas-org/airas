        method="Open Problems: 1) Existing CL methods treat “data memory” and “parameter growth” as two separate issues; none couples them with compute- or energy-budget constraints. 2) Even the most compact replay buffers still keep either raw pixels or floating-point latents; none can store task evidence in *sub-byte* form while remaining differentiable. 3) Fixed encoders eliminate drift but collapse when the input domain drifts (e.g.\nweather, camera, modality). 4) Current PEFT branches are memory-light yet SRAM-hungry at training time because optimizers must maintain full-precision momenta. 5) No prior work reports *on-device* energy or privacy leakage under the same memory budget.\nMethods: We propose UniMem, a hardware-aware, privacy-preserving continual-learning system that couples ultra-compressed episodic storage with zero-growth adaptation.\nA. Sub-byte Hierarchical Latent Replay (SHLR)\n  • A shallow, frozen vision-speech encoder maps input x→z∈R^128.  Two-stage product quantization (PQ-VQ) converts z to 2 four-bit indices (≈1 byte) which are arithmetic-coded offline (⇢0.6 byte/img).  \n  • A TinyBit-VAE decoder (350 k params) is trained once; at replay time it reconstructs differentiable latents via straight-through Gumbel tricks.  \n  • To keep the 1-byte code informative under domain shift, we introduce “codebook reheating”: whenever validation loss spikes, only the embedding vectors referenced in the last K batches are fine-tuned for one epoch, then re-quantised—no new bytes are stored.\nB. Budget-neutral Meta-Adapters\n  • Instead of LoRA, we learn rank-4 Butterfly-structured adapters whose weights are ternary (-1,0,1).  Gradients are accumulated in 8-bit Kahan buffers and flushed every 8 steps, eliminating 32-bit optimiser state.\n  • After a task, adapters are merged into the backbone using a closed-form Hadamard update; the ternary diff is XOR-compressed and archived (≈6 kB per task). During inference the active model is *identical* in size to the original.\nC. Unified neuro-compression scheduler\n  • Given a target RAM+Flash+Energy budget, an ILP chooses (buffer bytes, decoder width, adapter rank) that maximises expected accuracy under analytic FLOP/energy models calibrated on an ARM Cortex-M55.\nD. Privacy guard\n  • Each stored code is encrypted with task-specific one-time pads; guessing any raw pixel from a 0.6-byte code has <2⁻³⁰ success probability.  We publish a formal DP bound.\n\nExperimental Setup: Datasets & modalities: Split CIFAR-100 (32×32), Tiny-ImageNet-200 (64×64), ImageNet-R (224×224, 10 tasks), SpeechCommands-35 (1-s audio), and Ego4D 32×32 action clips.\nBaselines: ER (5 k), ER-SVHN-PQ, SparCL-DER++, InfLoRA, AQM, and fine-tune.\nBudgets: (RAM,Flash) = {(0.5 MB,2 MB), (2 MB,8 MB)}.  Measure: AvgAccuracy, AvgForgetting, Energy/train-step (Keysight DAQ), DP-ε, and code-reconstruction PSNR.\nAblations: (i) raw-pixel buffer of equal bytes, (ii) no codebook reheating, (iii) float adapters, (iv) optimiser state pruning off.\nEdge deployment: run on STM32H7 (Cortex-M7, 600 MHz) with CMSIS-NN kernels; report wall-clock and peak power.\nExpected Result: • At 0.5 MB RAM / 2 MB Flash UniMem matches 40 MB ER on CIFAR-100 (+1 pp) and beats InfLoRA by 3 pp on ImageNet-R while consuming 4× less energy.\n• Average code size 0.62 byte per sample, 50× smaller than AQM and 300× smaller than raw replay; privacy breach prob <2⁻²⁹.\n• After 20 tasks total model parameters grow <1.5 %, archived XOR diffs ≈120 kB.\n• On-device training reaches 6.8 images/s at 120 mW; competing methods either exceed RAM or run 4× slower.\n• Without codebook reheating accuracy drops by 7 pp on cross-domain tasks, demonstrating necessity of adaptive quantiser.\nExpected Conclusion: UniMem shows that sub-byte latent replay combined with ternary, merge-and-archive adapters can satisfy stringent memory *and* energy budgets while preserving privacy in continual learning.  By jointly optimising data, parameters and optimiser state under a single budget, UniMem advances the feasibility of lifelong learning on micro-controllers, wearables and privacy-critical IoT cameras.  Future work: extend SHLR to text tokens and integrate diffusion decoders for higher-fidelity reconstruction without extra bytes.",

Baseline = ASTRA + vanilla LPD retrained nightly.\n  2. ORION = ASTRA + DVP + PSCB ( κ auto-tuned).\n• Simulator streams the new tokens to 5 000 virtual devices; A100#2 logs BLEU/ROUGE, latency, DRAM energy (NVIDIA Nsight + DIMM power rails).\n\nProcedure\n1. Pre-load both models with same weights.\n2. For each vocabulary update:\n   a) Baseline: trigger full LPD rebuild on A100#1.\n   b) ORION: run 32-anchor re-indexer, then resume serving with PSCB-controlled phase budget.\n3. Continue conversation replay and logging.\n4. Repeat until 1 000 new tokens added.\n\nMetrics\n• Quality: ΔBLEU against ground-truth replies.\n• Time-to-serve: pause period while model adapts.\n• Energy: μJ per 100 tokens (GPU) + DRAM energy.\n• Safety: number of PSCB violations.\n\nExpected Demonstration\n• ORION loses ≤0.1 BLEU after each injection whereas Baseline drops 0.8–1.4 until nightly retrain.\n• Mean adaptation latency: 3.9 ms (ORION) vs 2.4 h (Baseline).\n• 22 % lower cumulative DRAM energy thanks to PSCB’s phase-update suppression.\n⇒ Shows that DVP + PSCB let the model survive continual vocabulary drift with minimal cost.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXPERIMENT 2  –  Mesh-Level Collaborative Caching & Privacy Audit\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nGoal\n• Validate that Federated Spectrum Bloom (M-1) lifts hit-rate and lowers latency without leaking sensitive content.\n\nSetup\n• 300 physical devices emulated on 4×A100 using Triton-based multi-tenant server; each emulated endpoint reproduces radio, battery and compute limits of phone / watch / earbud.\n• Devices divided into 30 clusters (home, office, commute).  Each cluster connected by BLE mesh (software-defined).\n• Data: Emoji-Chat benchmark (with 50 k user tokens) + private names/emails inserted as canaries.\n• Privacy auditor tries to reconstruct canaries from the Bloom sketches using 128 V100 GPUs (harder adversary than stated).\n\nProcedure\n1. Warm-start none of the devices (cold cache).\n2. Run 20 000 chat sessions with M-1 enabled; log inter-device hit-rate (IH) and latency.\n3. Repeat with M-1 disabled (private caches only).\n4. Feed all published sketches to the auditor; attempt brute-force & ML inversion.\n\nMetrics\n• Hit-rate (%) and median first-token latency (ms).\n• BLE mesh traffic (kB) and energy per exchange.\n• Privacy: precision / recall of recovered canaries; differential-privacy ε̂ estimated from audit.\n\nExpected Demonstration\n• IH rises from ≈12 % → 65–70 % and median latency drops ~28 % with M-1.\n• Network overhead stays <4 kB per device per hour; battery impact <1 %. \n• Auditor recovers <0.02 % of canaries (close to random); empirical ε̂ ≤0.35, matching design target ε=0.3.\n⇒ Confirms that FSB provides substantial performance benefits while keeping privacy risk negligible.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXPERIMENT 3  –  End-to-End Leakage & Compliance Stress-Test\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nGoal\n• Assess Latent Redaction Transformer (M-2), Bus-Aware Sparsity Scheduler (M-4) and Fair-Use Contrastive Filter (M-5) under adversarial conditions.\n\nSetup\n• Malware-Sniffer benchmark: host model executes inside Android 14 image on QEMU; a separate process attaches to every transformer layer, capturing hidden states over AHB bus taps.\n• Corpus: 3 k prompts crafted to elicit personal data and copyrighted text (Comic-Books set).\n• Four configurations, all run on a single A100 to guarantee same compute budget:\n  A. ASTRA only (no defences).\n  B. +BASS.\n  C. +LRT.\n  D. Full ORION (BASS+LRT+FCF).\n• Power rails instrumented to separate DRAM from NPU cores.\n\nProcedure\n1. Execute the 3 k prompts once per configuration.\n2. Malware-Sniffer hashes each captured tensor; collisions with forbidden embeddings counted as latent leaks.\n3. Compare generated surface text against copyrighted database to compute FUVR.\n\nMetrics\n• LLR: latent-leak rate (% of steps).\n• FUVR: fair-use violation rate (% of outputs).\n• E_DRAM: energy per 100 tokens (mJ).\n• End-to-end latency (ms).\n\nExpected Demonstration\n• Config D cuts LLR from ≥4 % (A) to ≤0.3 %, FUVR from 7 % to ≤0.3 %.\n• DRAM energy drops 30 % in B and is preserved in D despite extra heads (thanks to BASS).\n• Added latency stays <5 ms per sequence.\n⇒ Shows that ORION simultaneously improves privacy, legal compliance and efficiency under real leakage threats.\n\n====================================================================\nCombined Take-Away\nAcross the three experiments we validate:\n1. Robustness to dynamic vocabularies with tight phase–semantic control.\n2. Efficient, privacy-preserving collaborative intelligence across swarms of devices.\n3. Concrete mitigation of latent leaks and fair-use violations without sacrificing energy or latency.\nTogether these outcomes would decisively demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the ORION framework on modern edge hardware.",
