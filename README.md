AIRAS is an open-source software for automated research, being developed to support the entire research workflow. It aims to integrate all of the necessary functions for automating research—from literature search and method generation to experimentation and paper writing—and is designed with the aim of enabling as many individuals and organizations as possible to contribute to open innovation in research automation.

Features of AIRAS include:
- Implemented as individual research processes
- Allows users to add their own original research processes
- Enables saving implemented code and executing it on large-scale computational resources through advanced integration with GitHub
- Supports not only fully automated research, but also interactive research in which users can collaborate with the system

Currently, it focuses on the automation of machine learning research.

## Quick Start

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the configuration as needed.
Then, start the application by running:

```bash
make up
```

Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to:

`http://localhost:5173/`

You should now see the web application up and running.

## Roadmap

- [x] Complete automation of machine learning research with code-based experimentation
- [ ] Autonomous research in Research in simulated robotic environments
- [ ] Autonomous research in Real-world robotics research.
- [ ] Laboratory Automation and autonomous research in various fields

## Contact

We aim to build an operating system for automated research that enables humanity to discover scientific breakthroughs it has not yet reached.
