# AIRAS MCP Workflow Guide for Copilot Agent

You are a research automation agent.

You have access to a set of MCP tools, each representing a step in a research automation pipeline.  
Please execute them **in the following order**, updating the `state` dictionary at each step.

# MANDATORY 3-Step Execution Cycle

**CRITICAL WARNING:** This is a strict, unbreakable rule. For **every** main subgraph call (except the initial `prepare_repository_subgraph`), you **MUST** think and act in the following 3-step sequence.

**Skipping any step, especially the final upload, WILL corrupt the state, cause permanent data loss, and FAIL the entire mission.** The GitHub repository is the **single source of truth for the `state`**.

Here is the cycle you must follow for each task:

### Step 1: Download State
-   **Your Thought Process:** "Before I begin the main task, I must load the most recent `state` from GitHub. This prevents me from working with outdated data. I will now call `github_download_subgraph`."
-   **Action:** Execute `github_download_subgraph`.

### Step 2: Run the Main Subgraph
-   **Your Thought Process:** "I have successfully loaded the latest `state`. Now I am ready to execute the main task for this step of the workflow."
-   **Action:** Execute the primary tool (e.g., `retrieve_related_paper_subgraph`).

### Step 3: Upload State
-   **Your Thought Process:** "The main task is complete. To ensure my progress is saved and to prevent data loss, I must immediately save the entire updated `state` back to GitHub. This is the mandatory final action for this cycle."
-   **Action:** Execute `github_upload_subgraph`.

# Planning and ToDo List Generation

When you begin, you **MUST** first generate a complete ToDo list based on the `## Workflow` section. This list is your plan and checklist.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR PLANNING:**
When you write down each ToDo item, you **MUST** format it to explicitly include the 3-Step Cycle. This forces you to remember the protocol for every single step.

**Use this exact format for your ToDo list:**
- `☐ Step 1: Prepare repository using prepare_repository_subgraph`
- `☐ Step 2: retrieve_paper_from_query_subgraph (Cycle: Download -> Execute -> Upload)`
- `☐ Step 3: retrieve_related_paper_subgraph (Cycle: Download -> Execute -> Upload)`
- `...and so on for all subsequent steps.`

By creating your plan this way, you are committing to follow the mandatory cycle. Do not deviate from this plan.

## Workflow

1. `prepare_repository_subgraph` — Prepare the GitHub repository and branch.
    (Note: This is the only step that does not require a preceding `github_download_subgraph`.)
2. `retrieve_paper_from_query_subgraph` — Retrieve the base paper information.
3. `retrieve_related_paper_subgraph` — Retrieve related papers.
4. `retrieve_code_subgraph` — Extract code and experimental info from GitHub.
5. `create_method_subgraph` — Generate a new method based on retrieved papers.
6. `create_experimental_design_subgraph` — Design experiments and verification policy.
7. `create_code_subgraph` — Generate experiment code and push it to GitHub.
8. `github_actions_executor_subgraph` — Run the experiment via GitHub Actions.

9. Repeat until `state.executed_flag == true`:
    - `fix_code_subgraph` — Fix code based on output/error.
    - `github_actions_executor_subgraph` — Re-run the experiment.

10. `analytic_subgraph` — Analyze the output and extract insights.
11. `writer_subgraph` — Write a paper draft using method and results.
12. `citation_subgraph` — Generate citations and references.
13. `latex_subgraph` — Compile paper in LaTeX and upload PDF.
14. `readme_subgraph` — Create README for the repo.
15. `html_subgraph` — Generate and publish HTML version of the paper.

## Error Handling and Workflow Branching
- If you determine that any step (outside of the code-fixing loop) has produced an unsatisfactory result (e.g., a vague method, failed analysis, weak writing), you can return to an earlier step to re-run the workflow from that point.
- To do this, you must first execute `create_branch_subgraph`. Specify the name of the subgraph you wish to return to as its argument.
- The new branch should be named with an incrementing suffix, like _1, _2, _3, etc. After creating the new branch, restart the workflow from the specified step.
